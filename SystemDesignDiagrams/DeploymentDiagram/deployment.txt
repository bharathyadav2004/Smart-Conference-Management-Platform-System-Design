A deployment diagram in UML shows the physical deployment of software components across hardware nodes in a system. In this case, the Event Management System will be deployed on multiple servers and devices, representing the physical layout for managing the system’s operations.

Deployment Nodes:

Client Devices (User’s Device)
Description: This node represents the devices used by different users (Admin, Organizer, Speaker, Participant) to access the system. These devices include desktops, laptops, or mobile devices.
Responsibilities:
Users interact with the system via the User Interface (UI).
Send requests for registration, event management, feedback, etc.
Web Server
Description: This server hosts the web application and serves the UI to the user devices. It handles HTTP requests and serves content dynamically.


Responsibilities:

Hosts the User Interface (UI), including login, dashboards, and event pages.
Communicates with backend services to process user actions.
Deploys the Business Logic Layer to execute core functionality like event creation, session management, etc.


Application Server
Description: The application server hosts the core business logic components. It is responsible for executing server-side operations and connecting to the database.

Responsibilities:
Executes the Business Logic Layer, including modules like User Management, Event Management, Ticketing, and Notification.
Coordinates interactions with the Database and External Services.
Interfaces with Payment Gateway for processing payments.

Database Server
Description: A dedicated server hosting the database for persistent data storage. This server stores all event, user, ticket, feedback, and other system-related data.


Responsibilities:
Stores and retrieves data for users, events, sessions, tickets, feedback, etc.
Manages database operations securely (e.g., backups, recovery).

Payment Gateway Server
Description: This server handles all payment processing. It is responsible for validating and processing participant ticket payments securely.

Responsibilities:
Interfaces with external payment processors (e.g., Stripe, PayPal) for ticket payment transactions.
Handles payment confirmations and communicates the result back to the Application Server.


Analytics & AI Server
Description: A dedicated server for processing feedback and generating insights. It may run AI models for event analysis, user behavior prediction, and recommendation generation.

Responsibilities:
Analyzes collected Feedback data.
Generates reports and recommendations via AI Analytics.
Provides insights to the Organizer for event improvement.

Translation Service Server
Description: This server handles real-time translation services for sessions that require multi-language support.

Responsibilities:
Translates session content in real-time during events.
Works in conjunction with Session Management for speaker content translation.

Virtual Exhibit Booth Server
Description: This server manages the virtual booth interactions for sponsors and participants. It handles the real-time content delivery for booths.

Responsibilities:
Manages the Virtual Exhibit Booth features for sponsors and participants.
Facilitates real-time interactions and displays booth information.

Deployment Relationships:
Client Devices (User’s Device) ↔ Web Server:

Users access the application hosted on the Web Server.
Sends user input (login, registration, ticketing) to the Web Server.

Web Server ↔ Application Server:

The Web Server interacts with the Application Server to perform business logic operations (e.g., event creation, user registration, session management).
The Web Server sends requests to the Application Server for user-related actions.

Application Server ↔ Database Server:

The Application Server interacts with the Database Server to store/retrieve user, event, session, and feedback data.

Application Server ↔ Payment Gateway Server:

The Payment Gateway Server processes payments during ticket generation and sends the payment confirmation back to the Application Server.

Application Server ↔ Analytics & AI Server:

After collecting feedback, the Application Server forwards the data to the Analytics & AI Server to generate insights and recommendations.
Application Server ↔ Translation Service Server:

The Application Server interfaces with the Translation Service Server to provide multi-language support for sessions and content.
Application Server ↔ Virtual Exhibit Booth Server:

The Application Server interacts with the Virtual Exhibit Booth Server to manage sponsor booths and interactions during events.
