Draw solid lines to represent the associations between objects (e.g., Organizer and Event).
Number the messages or interactions sequentially (e.g., 1. User → Database: Validate Login).
Include arrows on the lines to show the direction of message flow.
Labeled interactions should clearly indicate the message or function being executed.
